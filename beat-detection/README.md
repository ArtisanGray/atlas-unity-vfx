Introduction

This is a quick dive into the beat detection systems available in unity, paired with a basic visualization system consisting of visual shaders and effects.

First, a few static variables are created, but also public, giving the ability to easily modify them in the Editor.
They consist of 4 different variables, one for the audio sample size, the number of bands in the visualizer, a secondary array for curved values, and ancillary array used in conjunction with the curved values.

Upon initialization, the component of the gameobject the script is attached to is grabbed and saved for later use.

Once the first frame is rendered by the engine, it then calls upon three functions until the program is exited:

GetSpectrumAudioSource -- a function that calls upon the GetSpectrumData function of the Audio class, sectioning and sampling parts of the audio currently being played.

MakeFreqBands -- the function responsible for splitting the spectrum data's frequencies into 8 managable bands usable by other objects.

BandDecay -- a function that curves the overall values of each band calculated per frame, applying a dampening effect to the overall visual output generated by the ProxySphere script.
Otherwise, movement of each audio band would be incredibly sensitive and janky.


Usage
